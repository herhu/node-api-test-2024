## Introduction

The Node.js API server is designed to serve resources in a Single Page Application (SPA) format. It includes various endpoints for retrieving posts, comments, and tags. The server is built with Express and uses common best practices for error handling, security, and logging.

## Features

- Retrieve a list of posts
- Retrieve a specific post by ID
- Retrieve comments for a specific post
- Retrieve posts by tag
- Error handling for invalid requests
- Input validation and sanitization
- Centralized logging with Winston and Express-Winston
- Security enhancements with Helmet middleware

## Getting Started

To run the Node.js API server locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The server will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Endpoints

### 1. GET /api/posts

Retrieve a list of all posts.

**Example:**

```http
GET /api/posts
```

### 2. GET /api/posts/:id

Retrieve a specific post by ID.

**Example:**

```http
GET /api/posts/1
```

### 3. GET /api/posts/:id/comments

Retrieve comments for a specific post by ID.

**Example:**

```http
GET /api/posts/1/comments
```

### 4. GET /api/tags/:name

Retrieve posts by a specific tag.

**Example:**

```http
GET /api/tags/sports
```

## Middleware

### 1. Validation Middleware

- **validatePostId:** Validates and sanitizes the post ID parameter.
- **validateTagName:** Validates and sanitizes the tag name parameter.
- **handleValidationErrors:** Middleware to handle validation errors and return a 400 Bad Request response.

### 2. Logging Middleware

- **Express-Winston:** Middleware for logging HTTP requests and responses.
- **Winston:** Centralized logging configuration.

## Error Handling

The server implements error handling for various scenarios, providing informative error messages and a consistent 500 Internal Server Error response for unhandled errors.

## Security

The server includes security enhancements using the Helmet middleware, which sets various HTTP headers to improve security.

## Logging

Logging is configured using the Winston library for centralizing log output. Express-Winston middleware is used to log HTTP requests and responses.

## Best Practices

- Use environment variables for configuration.
- Keep dependencies up-to-date to address security vulnerabilities.
- Follow RESTful conventions for API design.
- Implement input validation and sanitization.
- Use middleware for improved code organization.

## Testing

Testing for the server can be done using tools like Jest. Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests can be implemented to ensure the correctness and reliability of the server.
